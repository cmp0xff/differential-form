  abstract    = {Recently Kaniel & Itin proposed a gravitational model with the wave type equation [\square+\lambda(x)]\vartheta^\alpha=0 as vacuum field equation, where \vartheta^\alpha denotes the coframe of spacetime. They found that the viable Yilmaz-Rosen metric is an exact solution of the tracefree part of their field equation. This model belongs to the teleparallelism class of gravitational gauge theories. Of decisive importance for the evaluation of the Kaniel-Itin model is the question whether the variation of the coframe commutes with the Hodge star. We find a master formula for this commutator and rectify some corresponding mistakes in the literature. Then we turn to a detailed discussion of the Kaniel-Itin model.},

  abstract    = {The variation procedure on a teleparallel manifold is studied. The main problem is the non-commutativity of the variation with the Hodge dual map. We establish certain useful formulas for variations and restate the master formula due to Hehl and his collaborates. Our approach is different and sometimes easier for applications. By introducing the technique of the variational matrix we find necessary and sufficient conditions for commutativity (anti-commutativity) of the variation derivative with the Hodge dual operator. A general formula for the variation of the quadratic-type expression is obtained. The described variational technique are used in two viable field theories: the electro-magnetic Lagrangian on a curved manifold and the Rumpf Lagrangian of the translation invariant gravity.},

  abstract    = {Recently, a number of new Ward identities for large gauge transformations and large diffeomorphisms have been discovered. Some of the identities are reinterpretations of previously known statements, while some appear to be genuinely new. We use Noether's second theorem with the path integral as a powerful way of generating these kinds of Ward identities. We reintroduce Noether's second theorem and discuss how to work with the physical remnant of gauge symmetry in gauge fixed systems. We illustrate our mechanism in Maxwell theory, Yang-Mills theory, p-form field theory, and Einstein-Hilbert gravity. We comment on multiple connections between Noether's second theorem and known results in the recent literature. Our approach suggests a novel point of view with important physical consequences.},
